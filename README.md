Senior Project - Social connector web and android application.

When we started our repository back in the beginning of the fall semester, we had a lot of code that we were bringing
together. As the project evolved, we ended up using two main directories inside one repository to hold our code, /Android and /www. 
We decided that we would want to avoid creating two different repositories for each application because we were using
the same backend. This way any changes that were made to the database could be pulled to both projects.
